# Reversi

## Description

This project was developed as part of the first assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class (INF153 - 3531) offered by the Athens University of Economics and Business during the winter semester of 2023-24. It is a command-line interface application written in Java for playing the game Reversi, also known as Othello. The primary objective was to implement the game logic and a basic AI opponent utilising the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Single-player mode**: Play against a computer AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm.
- **Difficulty settings**: Easy, normal, and hard are available as difficulties, each representing a different Minimax depth.
- **Standard 8x8 board**: Classic Reversi board setup.
- **Move validation**: Ensures that all moves comply with Reversi rules.
- **Score tracking**: Keeps track of the score throughout the game.

## Roadmap

- **Add a graphical user interface**: Transition from a command-line interface to a graphical user interface to enhance user experience.
- **Optimize the heuristic function**: Improve the performance and efficiency of the AI by enhancing the heuristic function for better and faster decision-making.
